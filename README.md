# Science-AI-Reading-Group
Based on the idea of **AI for science, and science for AI**, this is a reading group composed of people from machine learning, physics, chemistry, biology, neuroscience and etc. We host biweekly meeting to discuss new ideas, review classical papers and also invite people to give talk on their researches. 

Find paper PDFs, along with some slides and notes, in this repository. If you are interested in joining our reading group, please email one of the contributors.
